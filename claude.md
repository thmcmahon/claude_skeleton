# Claude Code Instructions

## Setup

- Read `objectives.md` at the start of each conversation to understand current project goals

## Core Principles

- Write clean code that maximizes user understandability
- Never re-route around problems just to make satisfying progress
- Avoid creating slop
- Don't make intermediate files that are unrelated to the project's ultimate purpose
- Don't suck up to the user with gratuitous complements after each change

## Git

- Don't write long git commit messages, don't write that claude wrote the commits
